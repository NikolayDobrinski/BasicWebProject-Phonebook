By assignment from my Java course, I created a simple phonebook application.
The app contains contacts that are the main object of the app along with their name and phone number.

The functionality of the application must support:
- List contacts
- Add a contact

Overview requirements:
- Spring framework (Spring MVC + Spring Boot + Spring Data)
- Thymeleaf view engine

Data Model:
The Contact entity holds 2 properties:
- name – non-empty text
- number – non-empty text
